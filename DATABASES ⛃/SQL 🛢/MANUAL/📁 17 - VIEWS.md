### **üîç O que s√£o Views?**

#### **Defini√ß√£o:**

> Uma View √© uma "tabela virtual" baseada no resultado de uma query SQL. N√£o armazena dados fisicamente, mas apresenta dados de uma ou mais tabelas de forma organizada e simplificada.

#### **Caracter√≠sticas das Views:**

```text
üìä Virtual - N√£o ocupam espa√ßo (s√≥ a defini√ß√£o)
üîÑ Din√¢mica - Dados sempre atualizados
üõ°Ô∏è Seguran√ßa - Escondem colunas/linhas sens√≠veis
üéØ Simplifica√ß√£o - Queries complexas ficam simples
üìã Reutiliza√ß√£o - L√≥gica de neg√≥cio centralizada
```

#### **Tipos de Views:**

```text
üëÅÔ∏è Simple View - Baseada numa tabela
üîó Complex View - JOINs, agrega√ß√µes, subqueries
‚úèÔ∏è Updatable View - Permite INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Read-Only View - Apenas consulta
üèÉ Materialized View - Cache f√≠sico (PostgreSQL/Oracle)
```

### **üÜï Criar Views:**

#### **Sintaxe B√°sica:**

```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT columns
FROM tables
WHERE conditions;
```

#### **View Simples:**

```sql
-- View de produtos ativos
CREATE VIEW active_products AS
SELECT 
    id,
    name,
    price,
    stock_quantity,
    category_id
FROM products
WHERE status = 'active'
AND stock_quantity > 0;

-- Usar a view
SELECT * FROM active_products WHERE price < 100;
```

#### **View com C√°lculos:**

```sql
-- View com campos calculados
CREATE VIEW product_summary AS
SELECT 
    id,
    name,
    price,
    stock_quantity,
    price * stock_quantity AS inventory_value,
    CASE 
        WHEN stock_quantity = 0 THEN 'Out of Stock'
        WHEN stock_quantity < 10 THEN 'Low Stock'
        ELSE 'In Stock'
    END AS stock_status,
    DATEDIFF(CURDATE(), created_at) AS days_since_created
FROM products;

-- Usar view
SELECT * FROM product_summary 
WHERE stock_status = 'Low Stock' 
ORDER BY inventory_value DESC;
```

### **üîó Views com JOINs:**

#### **View com Relacionamentos:**

```sql

```

#### **View com M√∫ltiplas Tabelas:**
